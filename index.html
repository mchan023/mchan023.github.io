      <h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
      <p>The intersection of Asian American identity and illicit substance use is greatly understudied in psychological literature, especially with matters of mental health and drug use being stigmatized
      by Asian cultural norms. However, with an increasingly alarming number of fatal drug overdoses
      by Asian Americans at electronic dance music (EDM) events, attention must be drawn to the
      needs of this unique population. The present study characterizes this community by drawing
      from data of 1,290 Asian American young adults who participate in the EDM scene. This study
      also hypothesizes the impact of acculturative stress and feelings of social belonging on MDMA
      usage patterns. Analysis reveals a population of largely East and Southeast Asian, 2nd generation,
      college-educated young adults with strikingly high usage rates of MDMA, an illicit drug linked
      to the EDM scene. Multiple regression models were created that could predict MDMA use
      through various measures related to acculturative stress and social belonging. Findings revealed
      the significant impact of acculturation, acculturative stress, mental health, peer relationships, and
      desires for social belonging on this population's MDMA usage patterns, providing an important
      platform from which future research may launch much-needed additional studies of Asian
      American young adults and illicit drug use. </p>
